# A Hidden Rule in Genetic Codes Shapes the Folding Landscape of Microproteins Derived from Non-canonical Translation
This repository contains Python code, Jupyter Notebooks, and data to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript “A Hidden Rule in Genetic Codes Shapes the Folding Landscape of Microproteins Derived from Non-canonical Translation.” The code is organized into two main sections:
## 1. Long-Range Interactions Calculation
### Layout
`long_interactions/pdb_to_cm.py : `
## 2. Microprotein Stability Model
