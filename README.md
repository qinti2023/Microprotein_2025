# A Hidden Rule in Genetic Codes Shapes the Folding Landscape of Microproteins Derived from Non-canonical Translation
This repository contains the computational code used in the study “A Hidden Rule in Genetic Codes Shapes the Folding Landscape of Microproteins Derived from Non-canonical Translation.” The code is divided into two main sections:
	1.	Long-Range Interactions Calculation
	2.	Microprotein Stability Model Development
